# Spark to Code

Language: **English** | [中文](README.zh-CN.md) | [Français](README.fr.md) | [Deutsch](README.de.md)

This is not a source-code repository.  
It is a collaboration hub that connects ideas, pain points, and builders.

The goal is simple: make good ideas visible, validated, and implemented.

## Purpose

- For idea owners: share real pain points before ideas die in private notes.
- For developers: find meaningful side projects and potential collaborators.
- For the community: discover existing tools early and reduce duplicated work.

## What This Repo Does

1. Request hub  
Anyone can post software needs and concrete pain points.

2. Team-up space  
Idea owners can recruit collaborators and describe role/stack requirements.

3. Building updates  
Teams can share milestones, blockers, and progress once a project enters development.

4. Tool discovery  
If mature solutions already exist, community members can point directly to them.

## Participation Model: Issue-first, PR-second

### Issue-first

Issues are the primary channel:
- `idea`: submit a new idea or pain point
- `looking-for-solution`: ask for existing software recommendations
- `building-update`: post ongoing team or project progress
- comments: refine scope, suggest tools, or join the effort

### PR-second

Pull requests are optional and used for repository maintenance only:
- update docs and templates
- maintain curated lists such as `PROJECTS.md`

Do not use PR as the primary way to submit ideas.

## Who Can Post

Everyone.  
This repository accepts requests from all users, not only developers.

## Community Rules

1. Use issue templates when creating new issues.
2. Avoid vague ideas. Include concrete scenarios and constraints.
3. If a mature alternative exists, share the official link and suggest closure.
4. If you want to join a team, state your role, stack, and available time.
5. Ideas posted here are publicly shared concepts. Do not post confidential business details.

## Label System (English)

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `idea` | New idea or pain point |
| `looking-for-solution` | Seeking existing tool recommendations |
| `team-wanted` | Recruiting collaborators |
| `building` | Actively building |
| `solved` | Solved by existing tool or implemented |
| `duplicate` | Duplicate of an existing issue |
| `needs-info` | Missing key context from the author |
| `stale` | No activity for a long time |

## Maintainer Workflow (Lightweight)

1. Run weekly triage to deduplicate, label, and close solved threads.
2. Encourage teams to post progress updates in the same issue.
3. Mark incomplete issues as `needs-info` and close after long inactivity.
