# Contributing to Spark to Code

Language: **English** | [中文](CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md) | [Français](CONTRIBUTING.fr.md) | [Deutsch](CONTRIBUTING.de.md)

This repository is a collaboration hub, not a source-code repository.  
The core goal is to move ideas from pain points to implementation.

## Contribution Channels

1. Open an issue (default)
- Submit new ideas
- Ask for existing tool recommendations
- Share progress for projects already in development

2. Comment on issues
- Add concrete user scenarios
- Share official links to mature products
- Offer to join project teams

3. Open a pull request (secondary)
- Update docs, templates, and curated lists
- Improve repository governance and workflows

## Before Opening an Issue

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Use the correct issue form.
3. Describe clearly who has the problem and in which scenario.

## Collaboration Etiquette

1. Keep feedback specific and actionable.
2. When recommending tools, include official website or GitHub links.
3. If you want to join, include:
- your role
- your technical stack
- your weekly availability

## Public Idea Policy

Ideas posted in this repository are considered publicly shared concepts.  
Do not post confidential or commercially sensitive information.

## Suggested Maintainer Triage

1. Run weekly triage:
- apply labels
- merge duplicates
- close solved issues with references

2. For active build threads:
- ask teams to update milestones and progress in the same issue

3. For missing context:
- apply `needs-info`
- close after long inactivity if required details are still missing

## Labels

See `.github/labels.md`.
